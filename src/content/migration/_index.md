Here's some information on how to migrate to Strawberry from another tool, including Gotham.


## From Gotham

Up until v0.13.0 Strawberry was previously called Gotham.
This means that if you're still using Gotham, the switch is fairly simple.
Strawberry starts at v0.14.0.
These instructions will be updated when that release occurs.


## From Jekyll

Instructions coming soon.
